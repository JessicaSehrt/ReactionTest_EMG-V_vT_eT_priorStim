# Reaction test in VR with EMG interaction and multi-modal prior stimulation

Unity Project and Arduino code for EMG multi-modal prior stimulation in Virtual Reality. Intended to use for visual, vibrotactile and electrotactile prior stimulation in an EMG based reaction test experiment.


Inclusion of scripts:

MainLogic.cs - as Component of "Controller"
FeedbackManager.cs - as Component of "Controller"
PluxUnityInterface.cs - as Component of "EMG_Panel"
